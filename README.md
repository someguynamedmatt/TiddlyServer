# TiddlyServer

> Forked from [Arlen22](https://github.com/Arlen22/TiddlyServer)

### Why forked?

I want to take this project in a different direction both architecturally and ergonomically. Perhaps in the future the two (this and [the original](https://github.com/Arlen22/TiddlyServer)) can be brought back together. But, for now, the directions are a little too different.

### Major TODOs

> See the issues section for more up-to-date thoughts

- Convert _everything_ to TypeScript
- Dockerization
- Remove unnecessary dependencies
- Complete restructure of directories
- Code cleanup
- Update non-TW5 pages (e.g. `/admin/authenticate/login.html`) to React (maybe)

## Installation

The guide from [the original repository](https://arlen22.github.io/tiddlyserver/docs/gettingstarted.html) is the best place to get started.
